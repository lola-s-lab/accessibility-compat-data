# KPIs

## 1. Engaging relevant stakeholders. 

For this project, it’s crucial that we engage the right stakeholders, those with insight, influence and future implementation potential.

### Targets:
- At least 50% of engaged stakeholders are from key impact groups.
- Stakeholders demonstrate interest beyond awareness by providing data, reviewing work, actively participating in meetings, etc.

These will be measured by tracking stakeholder participation (how many go from passive to active engagement).

## 2. Clarity of scope and strategic alignment. 

It’s important that the work is aligned with stakeholder, developer and web user needs, and has an implementable and meaningful test scope.

### Targets:
- 60% (or more) of web features are rated as highly relevant through feedback in standards meetings and stakeholder workshops.
- The first version of the matrix provides data for a diverse range of web features that are most relevant to web developers.

This will be measured by:
- Surveying developers to understand their needs for accessibility data.
- Gaining feedback from developers and stakeholders on the relevance of web features.
- Analysis of the distribution of web features (which will be adjusted until evenly distributed).

## 3. Confirmation of the testing methodology. 

We will need to run tests to get the compatibility data, we need to have a robust, reliable and usable testing methodology, confirmed by experienced practitioners.

### Targets:
- At least two stakeholders review the methodology and confirm it’s acceptable.

This will be measured through GitHub reviews and approvals.

## 4. Interest in adoption and integration. 

The gathered data is only useful if it’s integrated into popular web documentation sites datasets, this KPI will measure the interest of stakeholders in adoption and will be necessary to how the project progresses in the later stages.

### Targets:
- One developer resource identifies a viable path for integration.

This will be measured by:
- Meetings to discuss technical feasibility and integration requirements.
- Exploration of different implementation options.
- Confirmed plan for implementation.
