[Examples of past MDN Short Surveys](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/developer-research/tree/main/mdn-short-surveys)

## Questions

1. When checking your website/application for accessibility conformance,
   rate how easy or challenging are the following aspects:
   (options listed in random order, each option listed with 5 choices:
   "very easy", "easy", "neutral", "somewhat challenging", "very challenging")
  - Testing with assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers, voice control)
  - Ensuring accessibility across different browsers and devices
  - Testing keyboard navigation and focus management
  - Checking semantic markup and ARIA implementation

2. Do you use accessibility interoperability data
   (information about how accessibility features work
   across different browsers, assistive technologies,
   or devices) in your development process?
  - Yes, regularly
  - Yes, occasionally
  - Rarely
  - No, but I'm interested in using it
  - No, and I'm not sure what this refers to
  - No, I don't see the need for it

3. If you use accessibility interoperability data,
   from which sources do you typically gather this
   information? (select all that apply;
   skip if you answered "No" to the previous question)
  - Browser compatibility tables (e.g. Can I Use)
  - Online documentation (e.g. MDN, WebAIM)
  - Assistive technology testing results databases (e.g. a11ysupport.io)
  - Community forums and discussions (e.g. Stack Overflow, accessibility communities)
  - Official browser or assistive technology documentation
  - Internal company testing and documentation
  - Open source accessibility testing tools and their outputs
  - Other (please specify): ___________

4. How do you typically use accessibility interoperability
   data in your workflow? (select all that apply;
   skip if you don't use such data)
  - To decide which accessibility techniques to implement
  - To prioritise which browsers/assistive technologies to test with
  - To debug accessibility issues that don't work consistently
  - To set expectations with stakeholders about accessibility support
  - To choose between different accessible implementation approaches
  - To validate that my accessibility solutions will work for users
  - To stay updated on accessibility best practices
  - Other (please specify): ___________
