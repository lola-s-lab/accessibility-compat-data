# Milestones

These are the milestones for the first phase of the project.

## 1. Technical landscape and gap analysis report.

This report will be a public-facing document that summarises the state of things as they are now, opportunities for alignment and a prioritisation of areas for future data collection. I will review existing tools and efforts that track or test accessibility and web feature support across browsers and assistive technologies, such as Browser Compatibility Data (BCD), Web Platform Tests (WPT), Axe-core and others. I will also conduct developer interviews to further understand their needs as implementers of accessibility standards.

## 2. Stakeholder engagement plan.

This document will highlight key stakeholders which will include assistive technology vendors, browser vendors, documentation platforms such as MDN and CanIUse, accessibility experts and EU public sector implementers. I will conduct stakeholder online workshops to understand the best methods of engagement, which will help me create a plan for continued collaboration.

## 3. Plan for the first version of the compatibility test matrix. 

I will lead co-design sessions with stakeholders, particularly MDN, CanIUse, to curate a list of a maximum of 50 high-impact web platform features to include as a minimum viable product. These web features will be mapped against a core set of 3 popular assistive technologies and browsers, and at this stage, will only be taking desktop browsers and assistive technologies into account.

   
## 4. Draft methodology document. 

This document will highlight potential methodologies for collecting the required data, testing workflows for both manual and automated testing, contribution models and validating the data. I will consult with Mozilla and Open Web Docs who own Browser Compatibility Data, Deque who own Axe-core, and others who may be identified in the stakeholder engagement plan.

## 5. Strategic alignment summary.

This will be a summary of the meetings, technical feasibility and recommendations for long-term collaboration with platforms, standards organisations and stakeholders. I will explore how the data can be integrated into existing platforms and how it will contribute to specification refinement and implementation testing.
